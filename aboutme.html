			<h2> About Me </h2>
			<p>
			I call Minnesota home, but I'm originally from Illinois. I was born in Chicago and lived
			there until I was 15. When I was in 10th grade, I left home to go to boarding school in rural Illinois.
			After graduating from high school, I moved to Minnesota to go to St. Olaf College. Now I've lived here 
			in the frozen North for ten years, and I think of it as my home!
			</p>
			<p>
			I am definitely a person who likes to keep busy! Monday through Friday, I work at Humboldt High School
			in the AOIT program. In the afternoons, I teach other classes: Monday/Wednesday/Friday, I teach theater;
			Tuesday and Thursday, I teach a class about making video games. On the weekends, I also work at a donut shop.
			I don't always have as much time for sleep or hobbies as I'd like, but I'm okay with that for now.
			</p>
			<p>
			I may work at a donut shop, but I prefer salty foods to sweet ones. I love almost anything that's flavorful or
			spicy - just as long as there are no olives. Some of my favorite foods are pizza, grilled cheese, and noodles. For healthier
			options, I love salad and most fruits. To see gorgeous pictures of most of those things, check out my photo gallery!
