		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p>
		I call Minnesota home, but I'm originally from Illinois. I was born in Chicago and lived
		there until I was 15. When I was in 10th grade, I left home to go to boarding school in rural Illinois.
		After graduating from high school, I moved to Minnesota to go to St. Olaf College. Now I've lived here 
		in the frozen North for ten years, and I think of it as my home!
		</p>
		<p>
		I am definitely a person who likes to keep busy! Monday through Friday, I work at Humboldt High School
		in the AOIT program. In the afternoons, I teach other classes: Monday/Wednesday/Friday, I teach theater;
		Tuesday and Thursday, I teach a class about making video games. On the weekends, I also work at a donut shop.
		I don't always have as much time for sleep or hobbies as I'd like, but I'm okay with that for now.
		</p>
