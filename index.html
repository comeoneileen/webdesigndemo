			<h2> Eileen King's Personal Website </h2>
	
			<p> 
			Welcome to the website of Eileen King, Humboldt High School teacher! I created this page
			for AOIT Web Design as a way to explore HTML/CSS and share a little about myself.
			You'll find links to a page about me, a gallery of photos I enjoy, and a YouTube video of a song I love.
			If you want to know more, feel free to email me using the link below. Thanks for visiting!
